# üè† Online Rental House Management System

**Online Rental House Management System** is a web-based application that simplifies the house hunting process by allowing users to search and view rental properties based on location and other filters. Owners can add and manage property listings, while renters can browse, search, and contact property owners ‚Äî all from one platform.

This project was my **second self-built full-stack web application**, developed to improve my web development skills by implementing CRUD operations, user roles, and interaction with a backend database.
